    "Title": "Lorre Ridge",
    "Content": "This image was taken on Sol 731 in the basin south of Husband Hill.  The image is evidence that Lorre Ridge, along with other landforms in the basin, is made up of basaltic rocks (solidified lava) similar to those found on earth.  These look to be vesicular rocks, formed by trapped gas bubbles which left holes in the rock as lava solidified around the gas.  These geologic findings could tell scientists more about how this area formed.",

    "Title": "Winter Haven",
    "Content": "Winter Haven was so named because Spirit spent a Martian winter parked on it's slope so that it remained at an angle where its solar panels would be kept at optimal warmth to survive the -100 degree Celsius temperatures.  The images composing this panorama, known as the McMurdo panorama, were taken over a series of months between Sol 814-934.  The panorama captures great detail in the rover's surroundings, from volcanic rocks, meteorites, and the El Dorado sand dune field to the rock patterns of Home Plate.",

It is located in the Columbia Hills.  Also visible in this image is Hankï¿½s Hollow, where the rover also spent some time.",

It is speculated that these rocks formed after a volcanic explosion and were then altered over time by wind.",
