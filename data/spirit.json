    "Content": "This image mosaic taken by the panoramic camera onboard the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit shows the rover's landing site, the Columbia Memorial Station, at Gusev Crater, Mars. This spectacular view may encapsulate Spirit's entire journey, from lander to its final destination toward the east hills. On its way, the rover will travel 250 meters (820 feet) northeast to a large crater approximately 200 meters (660 feet) across, the ridge of which can be seen to the left of this image. To the right are the east hills, about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away from the lander.",

The image is evidence that Lorre Ridge, along with other landforms in the basin, is made up of basaltic rocks (solidified lava) similar to those found on earth.  These look to be vesicular rocks, formed by trapped gas bubbles which left holes in the rock as lava solidified around the gas.  These geologic findings could tell scientists more about how this area formed.",

The images composing this panorama, known as the McMurdo panorama, were taken over a series of months between Sol 814-934.  The panorama captures great detail in the rover's surroundings, from volcanic rocks, meteorites, and the El Dorado sand dune field to the rock patterns of Home Plate.",
